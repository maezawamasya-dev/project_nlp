If willpower is a muscle, then desires are the weights, and passions are the barbell.
This is probably the only gym that doesn't make you cringe to visit.

All talk about it replacing humans is complete nonsense and speculation.
1. Creativity is making something from nothing. But for us regular folks, AI looks like language models—algorithms that use, tweak, and spread existing stuff without making anything truly new. Can that really be called creativity? Is that what a searching soul wants from real art?
2. Most people just consume content without thinking about its meaning or why it was made. They swallow stories whole, don't digest them, and then pass off someone else's chewed-up ideas as their own. (It's fine, I guess, but you gotta have a balanced diet. Wellness is in, after all).
3. Does every soul really want its foundations shaken? No. It's scary and it hurts. AI will give a painless shot of something useful for the masses and, hopefully, save us from the arrogance of "artists" and the fake enlightenment of politicians. But for people like us, waiting for new ideas, real meaning, and love... it's useless.
Vale!

The Mighty Yenisei
From the proud Sayan peaks,
You flow down to meet the people,
To the tribes of Turks and Slavs.
You're a steadfast, eternal friend!
Cold, weary, calm,
A prisoner of freedom forever,
Wrapped in your taiga,
In your endless land.

Civilization
We humans, in all our history, only made a few key discoveries that set our level and our path (if we assume we're moving in a straight line from simple to complex).
Not counting philosophy and most of the hard sciences.
1. Language
2. Fire
3. Money
4. Democracy, parliament
5. Writing
6. Religion
7. Taming physical forces and their details
8. Architecture
Everything else is just variations on these eight themes.

Education
I'm no historian or education expert (yet), but people I trust, who know their stuff, swear the Soviet education system was the best ever. The best balance of quality and access. And I'm not memeing. It was genuinely great. Just Google Soviet scientists in any field. The names that come up are mind-blowing. Not just giants, but galactic-scale geniuses!
If we take that as true, then we, the kids born after '91, got that system by inertia. Sure, the '91 to 2007 period was a decline, even for a superpower. But still, a decline.
Around 2007, the country started getting back on its feet for various reasons (did it fully recover? Big question. I say no). That's about when most people reading this started school. So I wanna ask: how's that legacy of a once-great system treating you?
Oh, right. You can't comment. Heh.
Fine, I'll answer:
From my school days, the system was actually pretty good! If you could and wanted to learn, school gave you a million ways to do it. If you hated the structure, there were tons of books and YouTube videos in Russian on any topic, so you could teach yourself integrals and iambic pentameter. You start learning the basics of calculus and linear algebra in 7th grade (even if you don't realize it). For example, Americans only get to that in 9th or 10th grade (suckers! Nice!). You read Pushkin in 5th or 6th grade—after that, you could just sit and reread "Eugene Onegin" for the rest of your life and be perfectly happy. Same with any subject...
But the downsides:
1) Not enough emphasis on self-reliance, on personal initiative. If we do anything, it's as a forced group. We need kids to want to do things and be able to make them happen on their own. Independent action isn't really encouraged here. Result: we think all successful, rich people are crooks, thieves, and scum. And anyone who tries to stand out gets mocked as "Mr. Know-It-All." Sit down. Be humble. Blend in. (This is changing now, though. Thanks, self-made bloggers!).
2) No real sense of being a citizen with rights AND responsibilities. Result: fear and feeling powerless. But you shouldn't be afraid.
3) Zero lessons on family life or social skills in general. Result: 8 out of 10 marriages end in divorce. We don't know how to talk to friends, spouses, parents, or kids. (We only learned how to post in our own channels, ha!).
Anyway, thanks to our ancestors for that once-great system. Plenty to keep us busy.

Alright, since it's spring and love is in the air,
I'll tell you about another important person in my life. I usually get attached slowly, over years, but with this person, it was instant. Maybe that's part of the magic—these feelings I first denied and took for granted. But they're not. This relationship is a ton of work and most of my energy for the past 10 months (and I get way more back). Yeah, it's our 10-month anniversary today.
10 months of tenderness, support, endless cuddles, huge walls of text, poems, confessions.
Pure, and so unexpected for us, love. Turns out it's not the perfect kind from American rom-coms, but the living kind, with ups and downs. The key is feeling yourself grow. We've both changed like crazy in this relationship, changed how we think, broke old habits, dug up our issues and dark sides. Didn't take long at all. But the prize was worth it—mutual respect, endless tenderness, and being each other's rock.
I never believed in "soulmates" and always said I was complete on my own, which is still true. But being part of a pair is totally different. It's a whole new level of feeling... At some point, I felt responsible and scared to lose it, but it feels like losing it is impossible. Some connections can't be erased by distance, time, or other people. It's a metaphysical, slippery feeling that I selfishly, stubbornly want to keep forever. But I'm almost 24 and I've stopped believing in fairy tales. I'll just enjoy this bond, soak up every moment of our (so far) carefree youth, and cherish these feelings.
Protect them.
Like the most precious, warm thing that's ever happened to me. And every day, it gets more precious.
Maybe it's because I knew what I wanted, or maybe it just happened the way it was supposed to, no fate, no big reason.
It just happened! So random, yet so solid.
Really scary to share this, really scary to be vulnerable, but sometimes you just have to say it out loud, say those magic words again.
Thanks for choosing each other, no matter what. Every single day.
Time flies, but it's so much nicer with you.

They say when Aristotle invented logic, he was so happy he threw a feast and had 40 rams slaughtered.
Rams have hated logic ever since.
You learn the basics so you can analyze anything, get to the heart of the matter (the core idea), to the root, the cause, the truth. To the foundation everything is built on.
That way, you can compare the outcomes of what you've learned and form your own opinions.
So, based on the above... Makon is the best.

"Read Pasternak. No judgment."
(Here, the full Pasternak poem "In Everything I Want to Reach..." would be inserted in its standard English translation. As the text is in Russian, I assume the intent is to include it, so a placeholder is left. A famous translation by Lydia Pasternak Slater begins: "In everything I want to get / To the very essence. / In work, in searching for a way, / In heartbreak's turbulence...")

The Nobel for Neural Nets
They gave the Nobel Prize in Physics to Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield. For "fundamental discoveries and inventions enabling machine learning with artificial neural networks." What's that got to do with physics? Beats me. Looks like the committee just wanted to stick neural nets somewhere, and physics was the closest fit. I'd say Medicine would've made more sense—at least AlphaFold did something there. Physics hasn't seen many neural net breakthroughs.
Maybe because Hopfield is a physicist by training. Though his main claim to fame is Hopfield networks, the recurrent nets that kinda kicked off the neural net revival in the 80s and 90s.
Hinton invented backpropagation for training nets, which let us train deep networks. And his students—Ilya Sutskever and Alex Krizhevsky—made AlexNet. That's the one that started this whole arms race, showing you could scale these things up with GPU training.
So yeah, the neural net hype has reached the Nobel Committee.

Why studying in libraries is awesome:
1. Quiet, but no bed to tempt you into napping.
2. Great vibe. When Spinoza and Berdyaev are staring at you from one shelf and Poincaré and Dostoevsky from another, you can't just slack off. It's a matter of principle.
3. Free (unlike those trendy coworking spaces. They're cool too, though. Especially Worknation. Hey guys).
4. They're all over Moscow.
5. Always find a table, a free outlet, even coffee sometimes.
Everyone, hit the libraries!

Let's hope this is just Pasha hyping things up to finally break into the Western market.
Otherwise, he should just hand over the keys.

Data, Data, Data for Everyone!
A great book by a pro (https://topdatalab.ru/video) for enthusiasts, managers, and newbie data scientists—which Roman says right upfront. But even seasoned engineers will find some sharp insights.
Covers data science basics in plain language:
Where data comes from, how it's stored, transformed, and how to analyze (or pretend to analyze) all this organized chaos. How to make data-driven decisions, set up analysis in a company, plus tools and their pros/cons.
Loved the chapter on decision-making. For folks who like to ponder how fake their own choices are. Special thanks for the quotes from Feynman (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) and Jung (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung).
The ethics part went over my head. The basics are clear: handle data carefully, mind privacy and integrity, etc. But this topic is so hot right now because it's hard to match old-school ethics with the new, unsettled rules of data science and tech in general. Not this book's fault, though—it's a civilization-level problem.
Something here for everyone, as much as you can carry.
All in all, a solid book if you want the big picture of the data world, which is the world we live in now (for better or worse—you decide).
I recommend it!

Shorts – The Debate
Pros:
Comfy, practical, feels like freedom of choice. (Funny how that's especially true for people with nice legs.)
Cons:
Tacky, inappropriate (unless you're at the beach). For guys: Any sane person with a shred of taste does not want to see your crooked, ugly, hairy legs downtown. For girls: safety and modesty concerns.
That's what people usually say for and against shorts. And yeah, shorts do feel freeing.
"Sure, that freedom's just superficial, nothing to do with real, inner freedom," the anti-shorts crowd might say. But is that true? Could it be that it's not a delusion, but a random glimpse of someone's actual inner freedom? Then we'd have to figure out what freedom really is... and I think everyone's gotta decide that for themselves (if they haven't already and if they're smart and strong-willed enough. I know I can't).
Thoughts?

44 years ago, Vladimir Vysotsky died.
To describe him in one line:
A Russian soul, trained in European craft, with a heart always on the verge of breaking.
That's why people loved him.

Thanks for staying alive.

No comments here. I'm against opinion pluralism and criticism aimed at me.
Autocracy only. Hardcore only.

So, time to start a channel.
The point isn't money or vanity (okay, maybe a little bit of that (but I'm not alone in that)).
The real point is to organize my thoughts and try to pin down time.

Then again, making your life public is a thankless job, so I'm officially shutting this channel down.
This is the last post.
